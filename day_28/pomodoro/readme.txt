Hi!

This Pomodoro app was made following Dr. Angela Yu's Tutorial at Day 28 of her Udemy's course: 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

To start the timer, just click the "Start" button (duuh xD)

This particular Pomodoro consists of cicles of 8 sessions, thus divided:

1 - 25' Work session
2 - 5' Rest session
3 - 25' Work session
4 - 5' Rest session
5 - 25' Work session
6 - 5' Rest session
7 - 25' Work session
8 - 20' Rest session
9 -> back to #1

At the end of each Work + Rest repetition, you get a little checkmark at the bottom, to keep track of your progress ;)

The "Reset" button erases the checkmarks and resets the timer to zero.

I hope this is helpful to you :)

Hi :)

This project -- Udemy_100_days -- is London App Brewery's online course, developed by Dr. Angela Yu.

This is my take at this course. In here you'll find my codes for most of the lessons (the basic ones I ignored, because I already knew the subjects).
Most of the code was written by me. Only a few lines was copied from the course or from another sources - like StackOverflow.
This happened mostly when I wanted to follow a slight different path from the suggested and needed some advanced functions I couldn't write on my own, or when I searched how to do some specific thing and found the code already written (for example, when I wanted my code to get latitude and longitude of a city, and found the written code for the module geopy).
A few other times this happened when the lesson was split between 2 days, and to follow the second day, I needed to continue from the code written by Dr. Angela, because the code I wrote the day before went to another direction, and it was too difficult to adapt my code to do what was needed so, to maintain the study flow, I just got the solution from the last lesson and carried on.

That said, I can confidently say that I fully understood every lesson that I finished, and every concept and idea teached by Dr. Angela.

If there's anything you find will be good for me to change, please let me know :) my email is gabriel_cb17@hotmail.com
